### What's Crucible?

Crucible is a continuation of [Thermos](https://github.com/CyberdyneCC/Thermos) as it has been discontinued.

Advantages over Thermos:
+ It is now possible to build. :)
+ Fixed several bugs.
+ Performance Improvements.
+ Updated some libraries.
+ Works with luckperms out of the box. No need to replace files!
+ TimingsV2 implemented.
+ You can see more changes in the [releases](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Crucible/releases) changelog.

## Build Requirements
* Java 8u141 JDK or higher
* Linux (apparently the project breaks on Windows).
* `JAVA_HOME` defined on your OS

## Setup the Workspace
* Checkout project
  * You can use IDE or clone from console:
  `git clone https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Crucible.git`
* Creating the workspace
  * To create the workspace just run the command: `./gradlew setupCrucible`
  * To create the patches with the changes made just run: `./gradlew genPatches`
* Building
  * Before you can build you must first setup the workspace!
  * To build the distribution packages run the command: `./gradlew buildPackages`
  * The distribution package will be in `build/distributions`
* Updating sources
  * Update sources: `git pull origin master`
  * Recreate the workspace: `./gradlew clean setupCrucible`
## Know incompatibilities and bugs
* Some coremods may crash with `java.lang.VerifyError: Expecting a stackmap frame`, we still don't know what causes that, but adding -noverify to your JVM arguments seems to fix the problem.
